# Noir-Chef 👩‍🍳

Noir-Chef 👩‍🍳 is the landing page of a restaurant that specialises in  *Homestyle Sushi* and *Dining Events*. It serves as a Menu for the customers. 

## Technologies used? and Why?

It was built using Vue.js + Vite, TailwindCss and Animate.css. It was a way to improve my Vue.js skills and learn new things. 

## Challenges?
I had challenges while trying to display my images from the *menu.json* file. The images weren't displaying after deployment but displayed on my local server. 
I fixed this with the help of my friend who had the same issue I had on his Vue.js project. To fix this, I created a Folder inside my *Public* Folder and stored all the images
that I was referencing in my *menu.json* file and corrected the path in my *menu.json*
